# Workflow

- to run directly for devs `php artisan serve`

- to build and test the docker container directly
```
docker build -t laravel-web-app .
docker run --rm -d -p 80:80 --hostname testing.com --name laravel-web-app laravel-web-app 
curl http://localhost\?code=OK
docker container logs laravel-web-app | grep "code=OK"
docker container stop laravel-web-app
docker image rm laravel-web-app
```

- to build and test the docker container ci/cd 
    - `git branch release-contatiner` and push

- to build and test the EC2 Gravitron from ci/cd 
    - `git branch release-aws` and push ðŸš§
